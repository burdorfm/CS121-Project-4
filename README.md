# CS121-Project-4

Mitch Burdorf and Reilly Cannon

Hey guys, this is our game. We made snake (and quite a few twists and variations on it). We gave the player lots of options
for tweaking game settings and modes. We even added a mini-game that we call Dodgeball. Some of the features are the most fun
to play on certain modes, so make sure you explore the menu and the different options. Three modes we recommend are classic
snake, snake with wrapping, and two player snake with bullets. You are also able to mix and match settings to get a fairly wide
variety of playing options, so we hope you have fun with it. Also, make sure you click ALL of the buttons on the menu.

Here is a list of some of the things we implemented:
- status, menu, and win/lose/scoring
- variablly sized world
- limited power for shooting bullets (loose section of tail with each shot)
- prize (the apple)
- damage mode (if the player runs into self or other player or bullet)
- leveling up (the game gets harder as the player grows because they have less room to move)
- various game modes and a game within our game (our mini game Dodgeball)
- multiplayer with a second person
- and a bunch of choose our own/modifications that the player can make in the menu

We hope you enjoy our game. You can probably tell we had a lot of fun making it!
