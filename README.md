# CS121-Project-4

Mitch Burdorf and Reilly Cannon

Play the game by running the PlaySnake.py file

We used the provided geometry code, and modified the PlayPong code to initially get our game working.

We made snake (and quite a few twists and variations on it). We gave the player lots of options
for tweaking game settings and modes. We even added a mini-game that we call Dodgeball. Some of the features are the most fun
to play on certain modes, so make sure you explore the menu and the different options. Three modes we recommend are classic
snake, snake with wrapping, and two player snake with bullets. You are also able to mix and match settings to get a fairly wide
variety of playing options, so we hope you have fun with it. Also, make sure you click ALL of the buttons on the menu.

Regarding our work as partners, we worked mostly individually on the single project using our Git repository. At the start however, we worked together to understand the how the given code worked and modify it into a working snake. Each of us then added some features and game modes, and we told the other what we did. While the overall work was equal, Together we worked on the buttet, two player, and the movements/graphicss/physcis. Mitch did significant work on the game within the game, as Reilly did on the menu. The game mode were evenly split, one person would tell the other that he had something he wanted to implement and would go do this. We both would then ask the other to look over it/make sure it worked/ fit into the game as a whole. As for when we worked on things, it was mostly whenever we had the chance. We would however periodically meet to discuss things and work on the game together, especially in the beginning and towards the end.

Here is a list of some of the things we implemented:
- building our own game = 10pts
- status, menu, and win/lose/scoring = 6pts
- variablly sized world (gave the player the option to choose world size) = 4pts
- limited power for shooting bullets (lose section of tail with each shot) = 2pts
- prize (the apple) = 2pts
- damage mode (if the player runs into self or other player or bullet or walls if wrapped is off) = 3pts
- leveling up (the game gets harder as the player grows because they have less room to move) = 4 pts
- various game modes (arcade and modern) and a game within our game (our mini game, Dodgeball) = 14+ pts
- multiplayer with a second person = 4pts
- and a bunch of choose our own/modifications that the player can make in the menu: adjusting speed, snake style(regular, crazy, skeleton), adjusting how much the tail grows. ~8pts

total: 57pts

We hope you enjoy our game. You can probably tell we had a lot of fun making it!
